This repository contains all the source code for our project hideout which is travel companion application with a focus on preserving loactions and places near and dear to people on micro scale rather that macro we think it is prudent to do so and would help people feel closer to each other.

# COMPONENTS

# 1) Authentication
we have created a custom capcha to authenticate user when they want to log in to our web application in order to ensure that no bots can be used to do so.

# 2) Recommendation System Using Graphs

we have also implemented a recommendation system for recommending places to user which cater to their own personal taste leading to customer satisfaction this is being accomplished by making use of graph data structure which can accurately identify the underlying relationship between nodes and serves the user on differnt levels that is on friend level,on user level and on Type level,the graph structure uses similartiy metrics such as Jaccard and cosine similarity between user and then recommends place based on the result.

# 3) Front end

we also implemented a simple but elegant user interface that makes it easy for user to share and access memories,as of yet we have an upload page, a login/signup page and a home page.
